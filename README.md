# Grade-prediction
In this deep learning project, I developed a model to predict students' grades in a physics course. Leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, the model captures temporal patterns in student performance data. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning, the LSTM model accurately predicts missing grades in the test dataset.
